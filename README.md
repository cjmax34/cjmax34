# Hi there, I'm CJ! 👋

## About me 🤓
- 🌻 I'm a 3rd year BS Computer Science student from the University of the Philippines Diliman.
- 💻 I don't specialize in anything as of the moment. However, I'm willing to explore fields that align with my interests. Right now, both artificial intelligence and computer security pique my interest, partly because I'm currently taking introductory courses on them.

## I'm currently learning 📔

## I'm currently working on 🖥️
- [🚙 ISKOmmute](https://github.com/derouru/ISKOmmute): App that serves as a commuting guide in the UP Diliman campus, currently being developed using SvelteKit and MapBox.

## Past projects I've worked on 📘
- [Data Analysis of Dis/misinformative Tweets](https://github.com/cjmax34/CS132-GoldenEra): A data science project that analyzes disinformative tweets to determine the most common reasons why twitter users regard the FEM regime as the "Golden Era." Our team used Python and the Pandas library.

## Fun facts about me
- ⚡ I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under ~~10 9~~ 8 seconds! I join local competitions whenever I have the time and money (for the expensive registration fees 😔). Here is [my World Cube Association (WCA) profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018MAXI03). I am currently averaging 9 seconds on the 3x3, 33 seconds on the 4x4, and 1:08 minutes on the 5x5. Both 4x4 and 5x5 are my favorite events as of the moment.
- 🎸 I play the guitar (and sing too, but only decent at best 😝). I used to be part of a band with my classmates back in senior high school.
- 🎮 Not only that, playing video games is a hobby of mine too and it is my favorite hobby. Right now, the game I spend a lot of time on is Apex Legends.
- ⛹️‍♂️ I don't consider myself to be sporty, but I play table tennis 🏓 from time to time. I enjoy watching other sports too such as Formula One 🏎️, tennis 🎾, and basketball 🏀.
- 📺 When I'm not doing anything above, I watch YouTube videos, movies, and/or series as my pastime.
