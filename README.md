## I'm currently working on 🖥️
- Project Vantage: A web application that is currently being developed by me and my fellow SWE interns at Pointwest Innovations Corporation.

## Past projects I've worked on 📘
- [Forza Horizon 5 AFK Skill Points Farm script](https://github.com/cjmax34/FH5-AFK-SP-Farm): A Python script that automates the farming of skill points in the popular racing game Forza Horizon 5. I made this out of boredom from manually farming skill points.
- [Predicting Stress Level by Training a Multilayer Perceptron](https://github.com/cjmax34/cs180-project): A machine learning project that predicts the stress level of an individual given their sleep health and lifestyle habits. We used Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for implementing the model. We used Streamlit for making the web app. You can access the web app [here](https://stress-level-mlp.streamlit.app/)!
- [Data Analysis of Dis/misinformative Tweets](https://github.com/cjmax34/CS132-GoldenEra): A data science project that analyzes disinformative tweets to determine the most common reasons why twitter users regard the FEM regime as the "Golden Era." Our team used Python and the Pandas library.
- [🚙 ISKOmmute](https://github.com/derouru/ISKOmmute): App that serves as a commuting guide in the UP Diliman campus, developed using SvelteKit and MapBox.

## Fun facts about me
- ⚡ I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under ~~10 9~~ 8 seconds! I join local competitions whenever I have the time and money (for the expensive registration fees 😔). Here is [my World Cube Association (WCA) profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2018MAXI03). I am currently averaging 9 seconds on the 3x3, 33 seconds on the 4x4, and 1:08 minutes on the 5x5. Both 4x4 and 5x5 are my favorite events as of the moment.
- 🎸 I play the guitar (and sing too, but only decent at best 😝). I used to be part of a band with my classmates back in senior high school.
- 🎮 Not only that, playing video games is a hobby of mine too and it is my favorite hobby. Right now, the game I spend a lot of time on is Apex Legends.
- ⛹️‍♂️ I don't consider myself to be sporty, but I play table tennis 🏓 from time to time. I enjoy watching other sports too such as Formula One 🏎️, tennis 🎾, and basketball 🏀.
- 📺 When I'm not doing anything above, I watch YouTube videos, movies, and/or series as my pastime.
